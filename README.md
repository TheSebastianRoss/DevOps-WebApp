# DevOps-WebApp
I'm creating a DevOps workflow to facilitate the development of a simple Web Application. The purpose of this project is for me to build up experience with DevOps technologies used for purposes like containerization and continuous integration.

## To-do
- [ ] Set up some form of build system (Jenkins?)
- [ ] Set up some kind of repeatable instance or Infrastructure-as-Code
  - [x] Set up a Docker environment
  - [ ] Create a container running the build system
