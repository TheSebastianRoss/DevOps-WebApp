# DevOps-WebApp
I'm creating a DevOps workflow to facilitate the development of a simple Web Application. The purpose of this project is for me to build up experience with DevOps technologies used for purposes like containerization and continuous integration.

## To-do
- [x] Set up some form of build system (Jenkins?)
- [x] Set up some kind of repeatable instance or Infrastructure-as-Code
  - [x] Set up a Docker environment
  - [x] Create a container running the build system
- [ ] Develop Application
  - [ ] Clear out practice apps
  - [ ] Do high-level planning
  - [ ] Front End
  - [ ] API
  - [ ] Back End
